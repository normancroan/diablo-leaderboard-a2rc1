## Now updated to Angular 2 Release Candidate 1
A new repository felt appropriate for this change as the overall structure has been altered.

###Changes of note:
  1. ngFor variables are now defined with 'let' instead of '#'
  2. The angular package has been split into smaller pieces, you'll see them in the import statements.
  3. Systemjs configuration has been moved from index.html to a dedicate file 'systemjs.config.js'

## To launch on local machine:
  1. Download node from nodejs.org
  2. Navigate to this project directory in your terminal
  3. Type 'npm install' to download and install the required dependencies
  4. Type 'npm start' to launch the application
